Please check the caveats related to your environment before using any of the below scripts/libraries or configurations in your working environment.

Prerequisites:
1 GNS3 GUI “v 2.1.21” & GNS3 VM installed and integrated “Please check my previous post regarding these steps”.
2 Install venv “python and nornir” on your Linux or MAC environment. In my case I will be using PyCharm (venv “Python + Nornir”) on Windows 10. For communication with the GNS3 Lab setup I installed “Microsoft KM-TEST Loopback adopter”. 
3 Cisco “IOS” image for Cisco emulated devices in GNS3.

You can check my article on Linkedin for details on how to set up GNS lab and use this script. https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kjaved_nornir-networkautomation-napalm-activity-6708690032410075136-hqH1
